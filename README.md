# Adaptive Typing App (In development)

## Overview
The **Adaptive Typing App** is an experimental typing interface designed to optimize text input by dynamically adjusting word placement. The app uses a minimal UI with predictive word blocks positioned ergonomically for faster typing.

## Features
- **Dynamic Word Blocks:** Buttons arranged in an arch to enhance accessibility.
- **Progressive Typing Experience:**
    - Displays typed words at the bottom of the screen.
    - Old words fade out after a short duration.
- **Minimalist UI:**
    - Dark theme with high contrast.
    - Responsive layout in landscape mode.
- **Expandable Design:** Future updates will include AI-powered word predictions and personalized layouts.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Flutter installed:
```sh
flutter --version
```
If Flutter is not installed, follow the official guide: [Flutter Installation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adaptive-typing-app.git
cd adaptive-typing-app
```
2. Install dependencies:

```

## Usage
- Tap the buttons to add words to the screen.
